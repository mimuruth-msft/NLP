If you’re on a tight budget, buying a brand new car might not be an option…and
this is where used car auctions sometimes are lifesavers!
-----
Yes, they are used…but being able to save thousands on a new car purchase
especially if you are low on funds makes them just perfect.
-----
.
-----
You may have to
deal with some repairs, maintenance, age, or mileage when opting for these
vehicles.
-----
But you’ll have the same performance and functionality almost like a
0 mileage version if you are lucky and or do your due diligence.
-----
Depending on where you are buying from, you may have a variety of options to
choose from and have control over the condition of the vehicle.
-----
If you’re buying from a private seller, you do not have a range of options to
choose from, and whatever condition the car is in, you will have to buy it
that way.
-----
But if you’re buying from a wholesale auction, you have a range of
vehicles to choose from.
-----
You also have the option of choosing either salvage
or clean vehicles.
-----
You also have a list of damages, and you can filter the
level of damage you are willing to fix.
-----
But you must note, that even though you can filter these damages, the
condition of the vehicles is not certain.
-----
You can request a vehicle history
report to get more information on the vehicle and damage history.
-----
You can also
request a physical inspection for more detailed information on the current
condition of the vehicle.
