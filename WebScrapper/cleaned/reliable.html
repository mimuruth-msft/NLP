Purchasing a car is a long-term investment, with the expectation that it will
provide dependable transportation for the long haul.
-----
But as Consumer Reports’
latest auto surveys show, not all cars can fulfill that promise.
-----
Based on our latest Annual Auto Surveys, these models are the 10 most reliable
cars today.
-----
We predict that they will give owners fewer problems than their
competitors based on data collected on more than 300,000 vehicles.
-----
(For more
details, check out CR’s Guide to Car Reliability.)

CR's Guide to Car Reliability

Our surveys take a deep dive into the numerous things that can go wrong with a
vehicle.
-----
We study 17 trouble areas, from nuisances—such as squeaky brakes and broken
interior trim—to major bummers, like out-of-warranty transmission repairs or
trouble with four-wheel-drive systems.
-----
We weigh the severity of each type of
problem to create a predicted reliability score for each vehicle, from 1 to
100.
-----
(That score is then combined with data collected from our track testing,
as well as our owner satisfaction survey results and safety data, to calculate
each test vehicle’s Overall Score.)
-----
To be considered for this list, we must
have at least two model years of data in calculating the predicted reliability
score.
-----
Based on that analysis, these models are the most reliable.
-----
**They are presented in rank order, starting with the most reliable.
-----
**

For more details on the models’ reliability predictions and history, click
through to their respective model pages.
-----
We investigate, research, and test so you can choose with confidence.
