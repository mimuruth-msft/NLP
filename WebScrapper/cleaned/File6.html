Buying a dream car should be easy and cheap right?
-----
That’s why today, online car auctions are steadily9 replacing traditional
auctions.
-----
With the aid of the internet, this has made auctions readily
accessible and available to more people plus the comfort of being able to bid
from anywhere.
-----
Online car auctions are an awesome option for auto buyers to land great deals
on their dream cars from the comfort of their homes.
-----
Different auction
platforms have their procedures and you have to do your research before
committing to one.
-----
Typically you will have to register on the platform, make a
security deposit, and start bidding.
-----
After you’ve won the auction, you make a
payment and have your car delivered to you.
-----
Easy-peasy!
-----
###  It’s a seamless process once you’ve done your due diligence and followed
the process.
-----
####

#### You can start by searching for your dream car with wholesale auctions
like Auto Auction Mall, Copart, IAAI, etc.
-----
Considering that wholesale auctions have hundreds of thousands of vehicles
listed for purchase, It is 99% certain you will find one that works for you.
-----
The vehicle status, however, might be listed as rin & drive, non-runner,
enhanced vehicle, etc.
-----
The preferred status to avoid buying lemons (vehicles that cant be restored)
is run and drive and in this article, we will talk about Run & Drive listing
on online car auction platforms and what you need to know.
-----
## What is Run & Drive

The term run & drive has left many online auction buyers in perplexing
situations.
-----
Sometimes they land vehicles that are clearly stated as run &
drive but end up not running or driving.
-----
This has caused a lot of issues in
the online car auction market.
-----
Run & Drive listing does not necessarily mean the vehicle is in top-notch
condition – though, oftentimes than not, it is.
-----
This status simply means that
on the day the vehicle arrived at the auction clearing house, it was started
and moved forward and backward under its power a feet or two, then the status
run and drive was applied.
-----
However, after being tested on the day of arrival,
it was not tested again.
-----
## So How is a Vehicle Listed as Run and Drive?
-----
A seller takes his/her car to the auction, and it’s checked into the auction
clearing house lot.
-----
At the time, the vehicle was checked into the lot the
following things happened and it was listed as run & drive:

  1.
-----
The vehicle started – either with or without a jump.
-----
This means that the key was put into the ignition and the vehicle started.
-----
Whether it was jump-started or started on its own, the bottom line is that it started.
-----
The vehicle is listed as run & drive once it starts.
-----
2.
-----
The vehicle is listed as run & drive if it could be put in gear.
-----
At the clearing house, the vehicle is turned on, put in gear and it responds.
-----
Automatically it is listed as a run-and-drive vehicle.
-----
3.
-----
Lastly, a vehicle is run & drive if it can move forward with its power.
-----
Listing a vehicle as run and drive is based on the conditions stated above.
-----
There is no guarantee that the vehicle listed as run and drive can be driven
long distances on the roads or highways.
-----
There is also no guarantee that the
vehicle will start with/without jump-starting it.
-----
Neither is there any
guarantee that the vehicle moves forward or backward on its own accord when
you pick it up from the auction house.
-----
All the information provided on the auction site is about the vehicle and is
information given by the auction clearing house as to when the vehicle arrived
at the lot.
-----
It is the responsibility of the buyer to confirm and carry out
research on the vehicle they want to purchase.
-----
#### When you purchase a vehicle from a wholesale auction site, the vehicle is
sold as it is, where it is with all faults.
-----
No information is verified by the
auction companies, you have to do your due diligence to avoid landing a lemon.
-----
After the initial test done by the auction clearing house on the day of
arrival, the vehicle could have stopped working for various reasons.
-----
This is
why the auction clearing house or auction platforms do not give a guarantee on
your purchase.
-----
## How Do I Avoid Issues With My Purchase?
-----
Since no wholesale auction platform gives guarantees on the condition of the
vehicles on their platform, it is your sole responsibility as the buyer to
inspect the vehicle.
-----
Run a vehicle history report or a VIN check on the vehicle before bidding.
-----
The
vehicle history report is a report that contains information about the
vehicle.
-----
It has information on the title, odometer reading, damage,
maintenance history, etc.
-----
You can request a detailed vehicle report from
platforms like Carfax for a few dollars.
-----
Auto Auction Mall also offers a free
VIN check on its platform for customers who have registered and made a
security deposit.
-----
The VIN check or vehicle history report, no matter how detailed, only provides
records of the state of the vehicle before it arrived at the auctions.
-----
For a
more detailed report on the current condition of the vehicle, request a
physical inspection.
-----
This can be done by a friend or family member but we
recommend a professional or using the services of an inspection company.
-----
Requesting a physical inspection will cost you a lot more than a vehicle
history report or VIN check.
-----
But you are sure to get the current state of the
vehicle usually through a 50-point checklist inspection.
-----
You will also be able
to verify the run and drive status.
-----
You can search the internet for reputable
inspection companies or have a professional mechanic you can trust to inspect
the vehicle.
