##  Tips to Increase Your Cars Lifespan

### Never Ignore Warning Light

Just like any machine your vehicle has a warning system put in place to alert
you to check out the issue.
-----
Unfortunately, some drivers don’t pay attention to
the warning signs until the damage is far gone.
-----
Don’t put off what should be
done today till tomorrow and that means you shouldn’t ignore the warning
light.
-----
Warning lights popping up on your dashboard means something is not
working well and could lead to costly repair or an accident if not checked.
-----
Research by Jiffy Lube shows that in a month or longer before going to the
mechanic, 29% of Americans don’t pay attention to their check engine light.
-----
Another survey by UTire shows that 91.8% of respondents delay their vehicle
maintenance.
-----
This is common in African countries also, causing them to
sacrifice an arm and leg for repair costs.
-----
### Don’t Drive on Empty

Some drivers tend to not bother themselves with the fuel warning light as long
as their vehicle is still moving.
-----
This is an easy way to damage your fuel pump
and engine, raking up high repair3 costs.
-----
If you constantly drive with an empty tank, your fuel pump is exposed to
higher temperatures with no fuel to cool it down.
-----
Once your fuel tank begins
to blink stop at the nearest gas station and replenish lost fuel.
-----
### Check Your Tire and Suspension System Regularly

Your car’s suspension system is a vital part of your vehicle which is usually
ignored until it becomes a major problem.
-----
Your suspension allows for better
handling and safety when driving, and protects major components like your
brakes, wheels, axles, etc.
-----
Potholes and careless driving cause damage to your tires, suspension, and
undercarriage.
-----
You need to drive carefully and stay alert while on the road.
-----
Check your tires and suspension regularly to ensure there is no damage.
-----
Check
your wheel alignment and maintain proper air pressure in your tires.
-----
Your car
manual has the appropriate amount of pressure needed in your tires or you can
consult a professional mechanic for assistance.
-----
### Change/Replace Oil, Air Filters, And Fluids Regularly

Replace oil, fluids, and air filters regularly.
-----
The more you drive your
vehicle, the more oil and fluids reduce, and the more your air filter works to
trap debris.
-----
These small but very important components have to be replaced
regularly to avoid damage to vital engine parts.
-----
Avoid erratic starts and
stops because it uses more fuel and in the present economy, that’s more money.
-----
## In Conclusion

The health of your vehicle is your responsibility, and if you don’t want to
break the bank to fix repairs in these expensive times you have to take
maintenance seriously.
-----
Create a maintenance schedule with the help of your
mechanic, you can find your car’s schedule in the manual.
-----
Make sure all
repairs and maintenance are done by a professional mechanic.
-----
Replace your
fluids regularly and make driving smoothly a priority.
-----
If the damage is done however and you are already spending a ton on repairs
and have your mechanic or auto shop’s phone number on speed dial, then it
might be better and more cost-efficient to replace your vehicle.
-----
You may also simply be tired of your current vehicle and are looking to make a
change or an upgrade or simply want to buy a car.
-----
Well, that’s where Auto
Auction Mall comes in!
