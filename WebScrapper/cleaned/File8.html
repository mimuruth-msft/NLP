We know what the word abandoned means – when it comes to cars it could mean a
bunch of different things.
-----
Vehicles are termed abandoned for different reasons – some are lost, stolen,
unclaimed, seized, or abandoned because of damages in private or public
spaces, etc.
-----
In a nutshell, abandoned vehicles are vehicles left unattended
over a given period of time.
-----
Some abandoned cars are left by the owners
intentionally for various reasons – debt, bankruptcy, mechanical issues, or
relocation.
-----
These cars eventually find their way to abandoned car markets or auto
auctions.
-----
Although you may land great deals searching for abandoned cars, you
still need to play your cards right to save.
-----
## What is an Abandoned Car Market?
-----
An abandoned car market is a huge market where abandoned cars are sold either
as scrap or as full vehicles.
-----
You might be wondering how these vehicles end up in the market when they have
no owners.
-----
Usually, the government takes possession of abandoned vehicles and
disposes of them in auto auctions.
-----
This doesn’t mean any car you see covered in dust is abandoned – some are but
not always.
-----
Different states have their own definition of what an abandoned
vehicle is.
-----
For instance, in Massachusetts, a car is considered abandoned if it is
unattended for 48 hours and can be possessed by the authorities.
-----
In the state
of Iowa, cars parked for more than 24 hours on public or private property
without permission are considered abandoned.
-----
In Texas, a vehicle can be seized if it has been parked on someone’s private
property for more than 48 hours.
-----
Big cities like New York, an unclaimed
vehicle with registration within 24 hours is seized while unregistered
vehicles are towed within 72 hours.

## Buying at an Abandoned Car Market

Abandoned vehicles are claimed by the authorities and then disposed of, either
as scrap or in a car auction.
-----
These auctions are usually government-controlled
and owned.
-----
Sometimes they are open to the general public where anyone can
attend.
-----
Or you need to receive an invite to participate.
-----
If you’re looking to buy a vehicle at an abandoned car market, there are a
couple of things you need to look out for.
-----
First, it is more likely that the cars will be worth more than scrap.
-----
But this
doesn’t guarantee you will land a good deal.
-----
When purchasing an abandoned
vehicle, you need to be careful and take one step at a time.
-----
If you’ve made up your mind to explore the abandoned car market, here are a
few steps to take to get started.
-----
### Steps To Take To Buy An Abandoned Car

#### Step 1

First, make sure you know the type of title the vehicle has or if it has been
registered at all.
-----
Take into consideration the state you are in and if it is
allowed by law to have abandoned vehicle ownership transferred to you.
-----
If
you’re not certain, contact your state DMV with details of the vehicle you
want to purchase.
-----
#### Step 2

Once the legal process is certain and you’ve made your purchase, have the
vehicle transferred to the mechanic for repairs.
-----
Before purchase, you must
have known the details about the vehicle’s condition and level of damage.
-----
Some
abandoned vehicles require more repairs than others while some are far too
gone to be repaired.
-----
Also, some abandoned vehicles have various health and safety issues – so be
sure to take all that into consideration.
-----
To know the history of damage, run a
vehicle history report to track the damage.
-----
With a vehicle history report, you
can also get information on insurance history, title, as well as the number of
previous owners.
-----
#### Step 3

Finally, the repairs are done, it’s time to take the car for a state
inspection to update the title.
-----
If your car came with a salvage title it’ll
need to pass the state inspection to be updated to a rebuilt title.
-----
Your car will be inspected by an authorized state inspector – once it passes
the test, you will go to the DMV or Tag office to have the title changed.
-----
Once
you’ve sorted out all the paperwork and documents, you will be issued a new
title – rebuilt title.
-----
## Ending Note!
-----
Searching for abandoned cars for sale and bidding on them is the same process
as salvage car auctions and wholesale auctions with minor differences.
-----
Most
states however accept abandoned vehicles as salvage – making the buying
process similar.
-----
You are likely to land a great deal and save on an abandoned car.
-----
But you must
be aware of the risks, the money involved, the legalization process,
retitling, and the change of ownership process.
-----
Once you’ve got this down you
are ready to get started.

are usually sold through wholesale auctions, public auctions, or government-
owned auctions.

Copart, IAAI, etc.
-----
These auctions have an inventory of all kinds of vehicles.
-----
Like abandoned vehicles, salvage, junk cars, insurance cars, clean title cars,
and repossessed vehicles to name a few.

platform that works best for you.
