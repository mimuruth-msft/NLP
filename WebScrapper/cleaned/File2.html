Shopping for a new ride on a tight budget?
-----
No worries, we’ve got you covered.
-----
Years back four-cylinder vehicles were associated with being underpowered.
-----
But
modern four-cylinder vehicles are breaking the stereotype.
-----
Though not as
powerful as six-cylinders upwards they are able to hold their forte and give
you the speed and reliability many car owners desperately need

Not only do newer models have increased power, but they still retain their
fuel efficiency and reliability ratings.
-----
This is a frown turner for many
drivers – especially with the recent hike in gas prices.
-----
But then again…

### What are Four-Cylinder Vehicles?
-----
Four-cylinder vehicles have four pistons, four fuel injectors, and four
cylinders powering the car.
-----
They are mostly found in small and compact
vehicles, especially sedans.
-----
They also boast of excellent fuel economy, ease
of maintenance, and overall value.
-----
If you’re looking for a functional everyday vehicle that will save you money
on fuel and is easy to maintain, a four-cylinder car is a great choice for
you.
-----
#### Advantages

  * Better fuel economy which comes in handy with recent fuel price hikes
  * Easy maintenance and more reliable than 6-cylinder and 4-cylinder variants
  * Less carbon footprint compared to other fossil fuel-powered vehicles.
-----
#### Disadvantages

-----
Now that we have a better understanding of four-cylinder vehicles.
-----
Now let’s
move on to used four-cylinder vehicles you should consider buying especially
if you’re on a budget.
