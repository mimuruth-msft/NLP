breakdown or checklist of sorts with more detail on how you can save further
in a car auction…

## How To Save At Car Auctions

### 1\.
-----
Do Your Research

One of the best ways to save money is to carry out proper research and due
diligence before committing to a car auction.
-----
This is the bedrock of safely
purchasing a car from any auction.
-----
This step is very important but many times
it is the most common mistake.
-----
Don’t just research the car you want to
purchase but carry out research on the auction platform you intend to use.
-----
Research on the car will help you avoid landing a lemon.
-----
Arm yourself with
information about the cost, maintenance, payment method, auction fees and
charges, location of purchase, etc.
-----
Don’t let anything take you by surprise if
not you lose money.
-----
### 2\.
-----
Budget and Set A Max Bid

This is the second most important step to saving money in a car auction.
-----
Setting a budget will give you an idea of what you will spend.
-----
Research is
crucial in identifying the current and estimated cost of the vehicle – making
budgeting easier.
-----
Your budget should have auction house fees, the purchase
price of the vehicle, repair cost, transportation, etc.
-----
Proper research and budgeting will eventually save a few thousand dollars from
unnecessary expenses.
-----
Also, you need to set a max bid – this is the highest
amount you are willing to bid on a car.
-----
Avoid bidding above your budget if you
want to save money, and avoid bidding wars.
-----
It is very easy to get carried away during auctions and exceed your budget,
especially if it is love at first sight for your vehicle of choice.
-----
### 3\.
-----
Be Wary of Physical/Mechanical Damage Cars

Heavy physical damages like blown tires, oil leaks, or other heavy damage may
need to be forklifted during transportation.
-----
They also can be rejected as
regular RO-RO by shipping lines and will have to be containerized.
-----
This will
cost you more money to transport and you’ll end up not saving money.
-----
This must be factored into your overall cost!
-----
Mechanically damaged vehicles affect the mechanical parts of the vehicle such
as the engine.
-----
Any damage to your engine may cost you an arm and leg to have
fixed or replaced.
-----
This is assuming the parts are readily available.
-----
You may have to pay extra cash to have it trucked from the auction house.
-----
### 4\.
-----
Make Sure The Title is Exportable

The vehicle’s title is legal proof of car ownership – and it’s a very
important document especially if you are buying for export.
-----
If the vehicle has
an unsatisfied lien, or bill of sale, or the vehicle is listed as a pending
title – it will not be eligible for export or accepted by US customs.
-----
For a car for export with a pending title, you will need a storage period of
30-40 days for the title to be made available.
-----
During this time you will have
to store your vehicle – making you spend more on your purchase.
-----
To save more,
avoid vehicles with pending titles, missing titles, or other titles that are
not exportable.
-----
In the case of pending titles, if you can factor in the extra costs and offset
it on your bid cap and then win the vehicle at the reduced max bid amount,
then you might only need to factor in the extra wait time and not
cost…especially if it is a vehicle that is not readily available at the
auction and is a must buy.
-----
### 5\.
-----
Avoid Flooded Vehicles

Flooded/fire-damaged vehicles affect the interior and mechanical components of
a vehicle.
-----
To save you money, these vehicles are a no-go area if you’re
looking to export because many shipping companies would reject them as regular
runners.
-----
Some may accept them but only as a non-runner RORO.
-----
This means Towable RORO or
FOrklift RORO that comes with some extra/heavy costs.
-----

This means you will have to switch to containerized shipment if the shipping
company accepts.
-----
This cost more money.
-----
You also need to think about the repair
cost for such a vehicle – it MAY be cheap or bite deep into your pocket.
-----
THere’s really no telling exactly how much you will need to spend to make the
vehicle drivable again.
