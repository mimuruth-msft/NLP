Who wouldn’t like to make a quick buck?
-----
But it becomes fraudulent and by extension a crime when in a bid to make money
or sell a car, individuals or dealers engage in sharp practices in order to
close a sale.
-----
We regularly see or hear scams involving identity theft, fraud, or the
stealing of personal information daily, especially in the banking sector.
-----
In
the used car sector, on the other hand, what we have is more skimming like
title washing, odometer fraud, or people taking the identity of state DMV
personnel.
-----
Many people are wary of online auctions because they do not want to fall
victim to online scams and frauds like this.
-----
This is a genuine fear.
-----
Understanding this fear, we’ve written articles on how you can avoid online
car auction scams when buying vehicles.
-----
####

#### When buying a used vehicle via online auctions, it is important to note
that all vehicles are sold “where is, as is”’ and unless you order physical
inspections, you can not be 100% sure of the condition of the vehicle.
-----
Used cars are just that, used cars.
-----
Mechanical components that have been put
in use by a previous owner or owners, part of an organization’s fleet, or even
a rental fleet including taxis.
-----
It is not realistic to expect brand-new
conditions on a used vehicle.
-----
Recent vehicles often come equipped with sensors and dashboard notification
lights that can give an insight into a potential problem or fault to **factor
into your buying decision and budget** before choosing to make a purchase.
-----
A seller hiding that fault or notification such as a Check Engine light is
another thing entirely.
-----
A check engine light can alert you if there is an issue wrong with your
emissions/exhaust system, electrical components of the engine like coil,
nozzle, sensors, or even inform you of mechanical issues within the engine
block itself such as a cylinder or piston head issues and to be honest, this
is the worst fault as the engine is literally the beating heart of any
vehicle.
-----
It is not uncommon to find shady dealers finding ways to tape up or hide these
kinds of dashboard notifications just so they can sell and make some quick
cash.
-----
In this article, we will specifically discuss how you can avoid being
defrauded into buying a used vehicle whose check engine light has been hidden
or covered, usually with tape.

## How a Woman Was Scammed In Georgia to Buy a used Toyota Camry

Recently, CBS46 Atlanta made a report of one Wanda King-Whitby who was a
victim of a scam.
-----
King-Whitby found the right car with the right price for her when she searched
through Craigslist and Auto Trader.
-----
The 2006 Toyota Camry she found was over
151,000 miles but it was what she wanted.
-----
She took it for a test drive.
-----
The
salesperson said there was nothing wrong with the vehicle.
-----
She made a payment
of $4000 and drove her newly purchased car home.
-----
“He just told me that the vehicle was in good shape, it did not need any
repairs; I did not need an emission and I shouldn’t have any problems with
it.” She said.
-----
King-Whitby like many used car buyers skipped a car inspection before paying
for the vehicle.
-----
She assumed the car had no issues and drove it home.
-----
####

#### Almost immediately, the car developed issues, King-Whitby said.
-----
“It
seemed like the transmission slipped or the engine slipped.”

A post-purchased inspection was done by Theo’s Automotive in Peachtree City,
Georgia.
-----
A mechanic found issues with the car that made it unfit to be on the
road.
-----
The vehicle was poorly repainted, and there were also signs that the
roof had been crushed.
-----
This was only the beginning of the issues with the 2006
Toyota Camry Wanda King-Whitby purchased.
-----
The only way odometer fraud was done in the past was to remove the instrument
cluster and roll back the miles manually.
-----
Presently fraudsters have found an
easier way to do this.
-----
King-Whitby unfortunately was a victim of this new
scamming method.
-----
The original instrument was removed and replaced with one
with fewer miles.
-----
There was also a disparity with the CARFAX report which
showed the car had 248,000 miles.
-----
The mileage reduced by 97,000 miles.
-----
## Check Engine Light Tape Scam

A service manager at Theo’s also identified another fraudulent element with
King-Whitby’s Camry.
-----
He demonstrated that at first glance the instrument
cluster looks normal until he pulled the semi-transparent cover which covered
the warning light.
-----
When a vehicle’s ignition comes on, the warning lights come
on for self-check.
-----
Others did on King-Whitby’s Camry but the Check Engine
Light.
-----
“Upon trying to see why it doesn’t work, we actually started peeling the
covering back and you can see they put a little piece of electrical tape on it
to black out where that light was on,” Berry said.
-----
He also explained that
covering the Check Engine Light with tape, the seller made it appear nothing
was wrong with the vehicle.
-----
Also using the tape the car will easily pass
emissions.
-----
Berry said, “ This was intentional.
-----
They knew what they were
doing.”

AP Auto Repairs in Douglasville, Georgia sold the Camry to King-Whitby was
visited by CBS46 Atlanta.
-----
They requested an explanation and the employees
claimed the previous car owner tampered with the instrument cluster.
-----
However,
King-Whitby received a refund of her $4000 and she said she will request an
inspection on her next vehicle.
-----
## How to avoid getting scammed

Not many people are as lucky as Wanda King-Whitby.
-----
She identified the scammed
with the help of Theo’s Automotive and CBS46 Atlanta and received a refund.
-----
As we earlier said, buying a used vehicle is risky and you can never be too
certain about your purchase.
-----
As a buyer, you have to take responsibility for
your purchase or risk losing money.
-----
Many buyers skip requesting a vehicle
history report or pre-purchase inspection before paying for their vehicle.
-----
Whether you’re buying from a dealership, a private sale, or a wholesale
auction we always advise you to request a vehicle history report or a physical
inspection before making full payment.
-----
A vehicle history report has records of the title, previous owners,
maintenance records, damage history, etc.
-----
You can request this from platforms
like CARFAX or Autocheck for a fee.
-----
Auto Auction Mall offers a free VIN check
for customers who have made their security deposit.
-----
A physical inspection is more detailed than a vehicle history report.
-----
The
vehicle history report has past records (damage, repairs, and maintenance)of
the vehicle before listing to be sold.
-----
A physical inspection is done by a
professional mechanic or an inspection company.
-----
The report gives you
information on the current condition of the vehicle you want to purchase.
-----
We recommend a physical inspection because you will know the current state of
the vehicle, the type of repairs you will do.
-----
Also, if it’s worth the money to
be spent especially if you suspect the vehicle’s condition.
-----
This will also
help you identify any fraudulent elements in the vehicle.
-----
