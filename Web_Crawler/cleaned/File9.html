There are companies and individuals out there who will try to scam you and tell you that you are guaranteed warranty coverage for your used car when you are not-
	Often, consumers receive mail and phone calls about extended warranty coverage on the vehicle and the companies that call or send you mail are wanting to sell you a plan.
Calls from companies about service contracts usually include high-pressure sales and you may feel obligated to purchase one- Remember that it is not required by your loan provider and you can get a service contract through the dealership, should you choose this route.

One of the tactics that these companies like to use is to tell you that your used car's warranty is almost out of date or about to expire- Take a moment to check your records and paperwork because it is likely that it is nowhere near the expiration date.

Another quick scam is fast-talking telemarketers- This scam works by talking so quickly that you only hear bits and pieces of information. As you put together that information, the service contract sounds good but, it is nothing more than a waste of your money.

NEVER give out any personal information about you or your financials to anyone on the phone or through the mail
 The dealership and vehicle manufacturer will never contact you via the phone to inquire about your personal or financial information.
