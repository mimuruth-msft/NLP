SUVs are becoming more and more popular as the years pass by and for good reason too.

The sport utility vehicle can offer you more room than a traditional sedan and it can head off road and allow you to sit higher up as you drive around on the blacktop.

It is no wonder that consumers continue to fall head over heels for the SUV and one of the top picks is the 2011 Nissan Murano.
