A shipping container, sometimes called an intermodal container, is a large, rectangular steel box that is used in the cargo transport industry. The term "intermodal" refers to the fact that the shipping containers can be moved from one type of transport to another: they can be moved by ship, rail, truck, or plane.

A car shipping container is specially designed to keep the vehicle secured during the transport process; Because car shipping containers can be moved from one mode of transport to another over the course of a long trip, it's essential that the vehicle be firmly held in place and protected during shipping.

Container car shipping is most frequently used for international and overseas auto transport; When overland shipping isn't an option, transport by boat is really the only logical choice, unless you plan on spending a significant amount on air freight
 Part of the reason that container shipping is a popular choice for international auto transport is that you can also ship personal belongings along with your vehicle. 

This aspect of containerized transport has some obvious benefits if you're making a permanent or long-term move to another country; Standard modes of auto shipping require that personal items be removed from the car.
The other option for car shipping by boat is a method called "roll on, roll off," or RORO auto transport. 
Roll on Roll off entails a vehicle being driven into a holding area under the ship, where it is then secured and delivered before being driven off the boat at the shipping port. 

 After choosing a company to work with and arranging the transport dates, they will pick up your car for transport to the nearest shipping port where it will be loaded into a car shipping container; During this process, the battery is disconnected and the vehicle is secured using industrial strength tie downs and blocking to keep it place.
 If you don't need the full use of a 20' or 40' container, ask about a discount for a "Less than Container Load," which allows the shipper to combine smaller shipments into one container at a reduced cost.
Car shipping containers are roughly 8 feet wide and 8 feet high, which means there's plenty of space for most standard sized cars and trucks. 
Containers sizes are either 20 feet or 40 feet long (car shipping containers are often the smaller of the two), which makes it easy to move multiple cars at once, if needed.
A car, used for carrying passengers on roads, is also called an automobile. 
What is automobile: The word automobile comes from two words "auto" (Greek) and "mobile" (French).
 A car is a lifestyle that epitomizes the personality of the owner. As the driver sits behind the wheel, a vehicle is an extension of his or her image from the fabric of the seats to the roof; To an enthusiast, a car is a well-crafted machine that requires exploration and admiration.
