The latest fourth generation of the Grand Cherokee has been on sale since 2010
as a 2011 model.

In true Jeep fashion, the Grand Cherokee is a great off-
roader.

It seats five in comfort and Jeep has used top-class materials inside
the cabin to make the stay a pleasant experience.

 Features

In addition to comfortable seats, the Grand Cherokee offers plenty of standard
equipment.

This includes dual-zone automatic climate control, Bluetooth,
Jeep’s Uconnect infotainment system with a 5-inch touchscreen.

You could bump the screen size to 8.4 inches if you go through the available
options.

These include satellite radio and navigation.

If you want to keep
your passengers happy on a long trip, you could opt for a dual-screen DVD/Blu-
ray entertainment system in the rear.

The sound can be blasted out of the
Alpine nine-speaker audio system or a 19-speaker Harman Kardon audio system.


The Grand Cherokee is powered by a range of engines putting out from 240
horsepower to 475 with the fuel consumption figures ranging from 13 mpg in the
city to 26 on the highway across the range.

The base engine is a 3.6-liter V6 with the the 5.7-liter V8 available.

Jeep
also offers the turbocharged 3.0-liter diesel V6 that boasts better fuel
economy and is packed with torque.

The Grand Cherokee comes in several trims
and for 2017 Jeep introduced the off-road beast, the Trailhawk.

You can play
with the engines but this is one capable off-roader with plenty of standard
equipment.

And it provides a comfortable ride on the road as well.

 Safety

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given the four-wheel
drive Grand Cherokee 5 stars out of five while the rear-wheel drive loses one
star.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has given it a range of
grades.

In four segments it received the highest rating of Good.

However, in
small overlap front crashworthiness testing on the driver’s side, it received
a Marginal rating and Poor for the passenger’s side.

Child seat anchors, as
well as headlights, have received lower ratings.

The 2017 model received a rearview camera and rear parking sensors became
standard safety equipment.

Additional features include adaptive cruise control
and automatic emergency braking.

You also get the warnings for potential
forward collision and lane departure.

In terms of reliability, the Grand Cherokee has been rated below average with
a 2.5 rating from J.D.

Power.

 How Does It Stack Up vs the Old and the New?

The fourth generation Grand Cherokee has been on sale since 2010 for the 2011
model.

There have been no drastic design changes over the years.

This means
that regarding the appearance, you can look at the previous models without any
major differences.

However, the standard equipment has changed.

Jeep has already unveiled the 2019 model, which will have an MSRP range of
$33,245 to $86,350, according to Edmunds.

The current model has an MSRP range
of $30,895 to $86,200.

There are a couple of changes from the 2017 model.

These are the 7-inch entertainment touch screen and the addition of the high-
powered Trailhawk model.

Based on the U.S. News data, the 2017 prices range from $25,000 to $43,000,
which means there is a potential for savings.

The source claims that with 11
trims available for the 2018 model, it is tricky to match the equipment in a
used car.

CarGurus listings show that a 2017 Grand Cherokee in Laredo trim
starts at $20,000 while you would have to pay $59,000 for the four-wheel drive
SRT model, which tops the range.

If you are not into technological gimmicks but would like a Grand Cherokee for
its comfortable ride and off-road capability, a 2016 model is also an option
to consider.

And this is as far back as you should go for the fourth
generation model.

The 2016 model received more powerful engines with better
fuel efficiency as well as a new shifter.

Pricing, according to CarGurus, for the 2016 model starts at $17,000 and top
out at $53,000.

The price depends on the trim, mileage and the overall
condition of the car.

However, if you are open to other SUVs in the same class, there are 2018
models you can find for a price of a decent 2017 or even 2016 Grand Cherokee.

The car is rather pricey compared to the competition.

 Bottom Line

The Grand Cherokee is the true Jeep with its off-road capabilities.

It
provides a comfortable ride on the road too.

The interior is well assembled
with high-quality materials and is certainly a comfortable place to be in.

However, there are cheaper options out there that will give you more for your
money.

However, very few have the off-road ability of a Grand Cherokee.

And if
you are determined to get one, maybe a good used Grand Cherokee would be a
better option as the design hasn’t changed much over the years.
