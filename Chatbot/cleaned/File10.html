We’ve got a list of places to get started below.

 What Methods Can I Use to Find Used Car Auctions Near Me?

Car auctions happen all across the nation at many different times and in many
different forms.

But finding one isn’t that hard.

All you need to do is
check any of the many free resources out there and choose what works best
for you.

Below are  places and ways to find used car auctions near you.

#  Search Engines/Business directory websites

You can start by doing a quick Google search of used car auctions within your
area.

Yelp and other business directories will also help you find local
businesses and events related to cars and used car auctions.

These are
websites that allow every business owner to set up a listing for their
business or event to promote their business.

# Government sites

You can find a list of surplus and used car auction sites of every state here
or you can directly ask your local chamber of commerce.

It is a common
practice for federal, state, and local governments to publicize their auction
list and information for free online.

You can contact them directly.

Note that
for many, you still have to be physically present.

Some of the best websites
to help you find these auctions are GovernmentAuctions.org, GovSales.gov, and
GovLiquidation.com.

# Car dealer magazines

Car dealer magazines are a great way to find your nearest used car auctions.

Two of the best around are Auto Dealer Today and Used Car Dealer Magazine.

Starting with these two will jumpstart your search.

You can subscribe to their
monthly issue, and buy digital copies.

You can also ask your local dealership
for auto trade magazines that also list used car auctions.

# Local newspapers

Even in the internet age, newspapers are still a great option to search for
used car auctions within your area.

Usually, you can find listings either
before or after the vehicles for sale section and in the business directories
section.

 The Problems with Public and Dealer-Only Car Auctions

There are two types of used car auction.

One is the public auction, which is
open to the public.

The other, known as dealer auction, is open only to
dealers.

What are the differences between the two?

What are the pros and cons
of either?

First, dealer-only used car auctions are open only to people with a dealer’s
license issued by the state.

You are welcome to get a dealer license, but
the process is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult.

To qualify for one,
you must comply with a number of demanding requirements (which can vary from
state to state).

One of these requirements is that you trade a set number of
vehicles per year to qualify for a license.

This means that if you are only
interested in buying a car for yourself, or a small number of cars as a
secondary income stream, getting a dealer license is not a good option.

Public used car auctions have a different set of problems.

In these auctions,
you will find vehicles in different conditions, including used and even
salvage.

So it’s important that you learn as much as possible on the cars
you are interested in.

Salvage vehicles present particular challenges, even
though they can be a very good investment.

Many of these cars have suffered
substantial damage, and so you need to be very careful to check their
condition.

You need to do your homework to avoid ending up with a poor quality
vehicle when bidding at a  public car auction.

 How to Access Dealer Auctions Online

You can take part in dealer auctions online.

These auctions have the same kind
of cars as other auctions, including cars that need repairs and salvage cars.

The difference is you are not bidding in person.

Rather, you are bidding over
the internet, similar to bidding online on auction sites like eBay.

As with in-person auctions, online dealer auctions are open only to holders of
a dealer’s license.

If you don’t have a dealer’s license and are still
interested in joining a dealer-only used car auction, search for online
dealer auto auction sites that allow public access.

 These websites will
provide you with a list of cars for sale to the public from dealer-only
auction sites like ADESA and Manheim Auctions.


More importantly, they will give you a very convenient way to go around the
usual requirement for a dealer license.

They do this by acting as proxy
bidders for you.

This means that they will use their own dealer’s license to
bid on the car of your choice on your behalf.



By using the site’s dealer license, you can gain access to a lot of cheap cars
that you wouldn’t even know existed.

Just make sure that your proxy bidders
are legitimate.

There are a lot of scammers trying to scam people looking to
buy cars.

If you are the victim of a scam, you can easily file a complaint
with the Federal Trade Commission and the Internet Crime Complaint Center
(1C3.)

 Why You Should Use Online Used Car Auctions

Online used car auction sites give you a great selection that is better than
what you would find at an in-person dealer auction.

In addition, you’ll enjoy
the ease and convenience of shopping online from the comfort of your own
home.



Buying a car at an online used car auction is simple and convenient.

 But
make sure you choose a reputable auction house.

You’ll be sure that they will
help you solve any issues you may encounter.

As with anything else, there are
of course some disadvantages.

But these are minor and similar to the ones
you’d face with any other form of used car auction.
