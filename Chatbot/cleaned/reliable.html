Cars That Go the Distance: Consumer Reports Car Reliability Survey 2017

Guide to Car Reliability

Our survey takes a deep dive into the numerous things that can go wrong with a
vehicle.

We study 17 trouble areas, from nuisances—such as squeaky brakes and broken
interior trim—to major bummers, like out-of-warranty transmission repairs or
trouble with four-wheel-drive systems.

We weight the severity of each type of
problem to create a Predicted Reliability Score for each vehicle.

(That score
is then combined with data collected from our track testing, as well as our
owner-satisfaction survey results and safety data, to calculate each test
vehicle’s Overall Score.)

Based on that analysis, these models are the most reliable.

They are presented in rank order, starting with the most reliable.

Kia’s five-passenger Niro marries good fuel economy with cargo versatility.

This front-wheel-drive hybrid uses a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, which, in
conjunction with the electric drive unit, puts out a combined 139 hp.

This combo is mated to a six-speed dual-clutch transmission.

Because the lithium-
ion battery is located under the rear seat, that creates a flat cargo floor
when the rear seats are folded.

We got 43 mpg overall, which is good but not
as good as the Hyundai Ioniq or Toyota Prius.

The handling lacks agility, and
the ride is a bit choppy.

The optional power driver seat provides better
support than the standard seats do.

A suite of advanced safety features is
available, including automatic emergency braking, smart cruise control, and
blind-spot detection with rear cross-traffic alert, but that tends to push the
price to above $30,000.

Developed with Toyota, Subaru’s first rear-wheel-drive sports car features a
2.0-liter four-cylinder with a choice of a six-speed manual or an automatic.

Handling is super-responsive, with cornering precision that makes the BRZ fun
to drive.

The car turns in promptly, with almost no body lean.

The steering is
quick and well-weighted.

At its limits, the BRZ is slightly more forgiving
than its mechanical sibling, the Toyota 86 (the old Scion FR-S).

That
difference makes the BRZ less prone to sliding its tail during spirited
driving.

The ride is also a bit more jittery than in the FR-S.

The cabin is
relatively plain, with well-bolstered sport seats, but the ride and elevated
noise can be taxing.

The Lexus ES has sound handling but falls short of being engaging or fun.

Uncharacteristic for Lexus, the ride is on the stiff side, and the optional
18-inch wheels make it worse.

The powerful 3.5-liter V6 and six-speed
automatic got a good 25 mpg overall.

But we find the hybrid more appealing,
thanks to its combination of size and fuel economy, returning a class-leading
36 mpg overall and 44 on the highway in our tests.

Inside, the quiet cabin
looks good at first, but some cheap touches are apparent.

The mouselike
infotainment interface is distracting and convoluted.

Automatic emergency
braking and lane-departure warning are standard.

The GS competes well, delivering a balanced combination of ride, handling,
quietness, and roominess.

Engaging to drive, the car’s good handling and taut
yet supple ride compete well against German rivals.

Its strong 3.5-liter V6
returned 21 mpg overall in our tests.

Rear-drive versions get an eight-speed
automatic, and AWD versions get a six-speed automatic.

A hybrid with a
continuously variable transmission is also available.

Interior space is on par
for the class, and the cabin is nicely furnished.

A distracting mouselike
controller works the infotainment systems.

A high-performance GS F with a
467-hp V8 is available.

2016 brings a rear-drive 200t with a turbo four-
cylinder.

A blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert is standard.


A tidy, compact crossover, the Q3 competes with the BMW X1 and Mercedes-Benz
GLA.

Overall, it manages to deliver a premium driving experience similar to
the Q5 but in a 10-inch-shorter package.

The energetic 200-hp, 2.0-liter turbo
four-cylinder is mated to a conventional six-speed automatic and returned 22
mpg overall in our tests.

This is a quiet SUV with a firm, comfortable ride
and responsive handling.

The cabin is a bit simplistic-looking, but it gives a
sense of quality.

Demerits include the tight quarters and cramped driving
position.

The controls are complicated at first, but they prove to be logical
with some familiarity.

Front- and all-wheel drive are available.


For years, the RAV4 has consistently been among the top-ranked small SUVs.

The
current RAV4’s cabin is quieter, the ride is smoother, it has a suite of
advanced safety features, and it offers a frugal hybrid version.

The energetic
2.5-liter four-cylinder and smooth six-speed automatic returned 24 mpg overall
in our tests of an AWD version.

The hybrid version gets a terrific 31 mpg
overall.

Handling is responsive and very secure.

Inside, the controls are
clear and intuitive.

Though the XLE comes with automatic climate control and a
sunroof, you must step up to the Limited trim to get adjustable lumbar support
and the more comfortable faux-leather seats.

Access is very easy, and the rear
seat is roomy.

Forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking are
standard.


In our tests, the IS came up short as a sports sedan.

Handling is secure but
not engaging enough to run with the best in the class.

Ride comfort is neither
tied down nor plush.

Even the punchy IS 350 is underwhelming to drive.

A
260-hp V6 powers the IS 300, which gives it more zip, but its fuel economy of
20 mpg overall is uncompetitive in the class.

Still, the interior is extremely
cramped, and getting in and out is an ungraceful chore.

All-wheel-drive
versions have a pronounced hump by the driver's right leg.

Fit and finish is
okay but not a standout, and the mouselike infotainment controller is
distracting to use.

A 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder is available, but only in
rear-wheel drive.

This wagon version of the previous-generation Prius offers a very roomy rear
seat and a generous cargo area.

It’s about the size of the Ford C-Max, its
main competitor.

Despite its extra weight and a less aerodynamic shape, the V
still got an excellent 41 mpg overall in our tests.

The electric motor and
engine have to work fairly hard, especially when the car is loaded with cargo.

The ride is comfortable, but uneven pavement can cause an annoying side-to-
side rocking.

Handling is sound and secure but hardly inspiring.

Rear
visibility is better than in the standard Prius.

A larger 4.1-inch dash-top
screen for trip computer functions is also new.

Forward-collision warning with
automatic braking is available but not standard.

2018 is the final year for
the Prius V.


This smaller, less expensive alternative to the regular Prius feels like a
spartan subcompact, but with a hybrid powertrain.

In the end, you pretty much
get what you pay for, and it is no substitute for the real Prius.

The C has a
harsh ride, a noisy engine, and slow acceleration.

The interior looks and
feels cheap, the driving position and rear seats are cramped, and there’s
little cargo space.

However, its 37 mpg makes the Prius C one of the most
frugal vehicles we’ve tested, and its 43 mpg overall is just 1 mpg less than
the previous-generation Prius hatchback.

Its tiny dimensions make it a natural
for urban driving.

Automatic emergency braking is standard.

10 Least Reliable Cars

Although long in the tooth, the Q70 is still competitive, with a lively 330-hp
V6 and a smooth seven-speed automatic that returned 21 mpg overall in our
tests.

A V8 and a V6 hybrid are also available.

Handling is quite agile, with
communicative steering.

The ride is firm and absorbs bumps well but trails the
competition in terms of plushness.

The Q70 is also behind the competition in
terms of cabin quietness, partly because of the noticeable engine noise under
high revs.

Very good interior quality, a roomy rear seat, and easy-to-use
controls are positives, although cabin ambience is austere.

Blind-spot
intervention is optional.

An extended-length L version with a roomier rear
seat is also available.

The Q70 might lack some pizzazz, but it generally
commands significantly lower prices than its competitors.
