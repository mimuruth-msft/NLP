Do a car check using VIN or ask the dealer for the Vehicle history
report

Regardless of where you are buying your car form, it is only proper that you
know everything about a used car before buying it.

If for no other reason, at
the very least for safety and to verify that you are not buying a stolen car.

A vehicle report is a treasure trove of information that will help you
understand the vehicle’s history, the extent of repair work done on it and the
actual condition.

This is also a good time to double check the make, model,
year, license plate and vehicle identification number (VIN).

Before buying the
car, request for the VIN and run a search.

VIN cloning is when a thief replaces the VIN of a stolen vehicle with the VIN of another car.
It is a rapidly rising problem that can be solved with a careful VIN search.
Title and vehicle history reports can identify many red flags for you such as last reported mileage, number of previous owners and if the car’s real title is “junk” or “salvage.”
You’ll also be able to know of any significant issues like accidents and floods.
You can get the vehicle report with the car’s VIN in sites like CarProof,
Carfax and the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System.
A vehicle report can prevent you from buying a nightmare.
Triple check the car’s condition
A simple vehicle inspection can reveal a lot about the “true” state of a vehicle.
The inspection can reveal Odometer Fraud: This is when the mileage of
a car has been tampered with to read a lesser mileage and deceive unsuspectingbuyers.
A closer look at the dashboard should reveal scratches or evidence of
tampering.
If you’re not sure, the vehicle history should reveal any tampering.
A vehicle with 3 previous owners and built in 2010 cannot have a mileage of under 14,000.
Flooded cars being passed off as used cars with no issues:
Flooded vehicles will almost certainly come with its fair share of electrical problems and other mechanical headaches.
Dishonest dealers will try to mask this so they can make a profit.
A cursory inspection might reveal funny odors within the car.
A strong pleasant scent within the vehicle is also a sign of someone trying to mask the smell of wet interiors.
Hidden mechanical problems not captured in pictures: A look at the engine and underside of a car can reveal a lot about its real state.
Sometimes, a rusted away underneath is a good indicator of the general condition of the vehicle.
Occasionally minor dents and scratches are masked with a cleverly done paint job.
Not all users know what to look for when physically inspecting a car.
It is not a bad idea to reach out to trained or professional help for this.
Hiring a licensed mechanic or auto inspection service might seem like extra money but the satisfaction of buying a car as advertised makes it worth it.
Try to physically inspect the car before the final purchase especially when dealing with private dealers or unlicensed auctions.

Beware of title washing and warranty scams
In most cases, a car is given “salvage” status if it has been involved in multiple accidents or has been flooded and is suitable for parts.
Title washing is when the title of the car is altered so it does not reflect this, leading buyers to buy potentially problematic vehicles.

Salvage cars in auctions are cars that insurance houses have weighed the cost of repairs against the value of the car and didn’t see it as a cost they are willing to absorb.

So they auction it off undervalued at its current condition.

Do note that there are salvage cars that can be fixed and restored to good working condition and not all are for scrap or parts.

A proper vehicle history check and inspection will help you avoid this type of scam.

Some dealers will claim their used car inventory is still covered by the manufacturer’s warranty.

While this may be true in some cases, usually accidents, floods and significant faults will have voided this claim.

Don’t just trust or assume the dealer is being honest.
